The goal of this repository is to provide a place for people of all experience levels to learn more about cryptocurrencies and their underlying technologies. It's called "Navigator" because we would like this to act as a map leading to the relevant information someone might be looking for, whether they are totally new to cryptocurrencies and just want to know how to buy and "HODL" some or want to dig deeper.

Keep this in mind when contributing content. Ideally contributions won't be too text heavy, but rather will help lead people in the right direction by providing introductory context to a particular topic and then linking to in depth articles related to that topic.

Check the Issues tab for questions that need answering. To submit an answer, fork this repo, add your content and submit a Pull Request. Make sure content is in a file and directory that make sense in relation to the topic. Where relevant also add internal links so people can find your content.
