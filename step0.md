# Step 0 - The Why

Welcome to the crazy wonderful world of blockchains and cryptocurrencies!

So you've heard about this new technology that people are saying is going to change the world, maybe you know someone that's made some money from it, or maybe you're just a little curious about what the fuss is all about. Step 0 of Crypto GPS is the place to start to see where this journey will take you and hopefully get closer to where you want to be (and maybe even figure out where that somewhere is). Here is where you can get introduced to the basic concepts behind the technology and learn a little bit about where it all came from.

## Where it all started
Pretty much everything in the world of cryptocurrencies start from a shared root. If you want to put yourself on a solid footing in this industry, whether trading, researching, developing, or starting a business, it's important to understand *why* we have blockchains and cryptocurrencies in the first place and where they came from.

### Byzantine Generals' Problem
This is a computer science problem dating back to the early 1980s that deals with the issue of trust within a system with incomplete information. In a system of digital money for example, how do you ensure that the person sending you money actually owns that money and how do you prove that you have received it when sent? Before blockchains, this was resolved through trusted third parties like Visa, PayPal, ACH, and central banks. This was the problem researchers were trying to solve that eventually led to the creation of Bitcoin and its underlying Blockchain technology.

### Bitcoin Predecessors
Bitcoin wasn't the first attempt to solve the problem of trustless, decentralized, digital money. Learn more about the previous attempts that inspired Satoshi Nakomoto's groundbreaking innovation:

- [Hashcash](http://www.hashcash.org/)
- [Bit Gold](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/bit-gold/)

### Bitcoin
Almost all cryptocurrencies currently in circulation are either a direct fork of the original Bitcoin codebase or at least in someway inspired by its system. Most whitepapers reference the original, and whether they are pointing out what it does well or what's broken and how their project will fix it, this is the reference point that most people are starting from. Luckily, the Bitcoin Whitepaper is not very technical and relatively easy to follow, even if you're not familiar with the underlying code or cryptography.

## Foundational Technologies
A lot of what is behind Bitcoin and the related blockchains that it later inspired is based off of much older technologies that had been in use for decades, mostly in the area of cryptography. Follow the links below to learn more about how they work:

- [Public Key Cryptography](./cryptography/public-key.md)
- [Hashing algorithms](./cryptography/hashing.md) (e.g. SHA256)
